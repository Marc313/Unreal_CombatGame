# Combat Game in Unreal Engine

In this Unreal Engine experiment, I created a double boss fight. The goal of this project was to create a boss fight with two bosses, that can work together and help each other out.
The Dark Astronaut can shoot an ice beam that hurts the player and slows him down for several seconds. This makes it easier for the other boss to hit the player as well.
This attack is also very dangerous when the other boss is performing a charging attack.
Zlorp the Telepathic Alien has a shielding ability, that grants both bosses extra defence. The astronaut likes to perform close range melee attacks when it is shielded by Zlorp.
Do you have what it takes to defeat the bosses?
